# Smart Home Monitoring and Control Solution (SCADA/HMI) - Fall 2025

This repository is for our group project in CSCN72030 – Project III.

We are developing a Smart Home Monitoring and Control System that allows users to monitor and manage home devices such as lights, door locks, fans, temperature, and different sensors from a single dashboard built in C#.

Team Members:  
- Emmanuel  
- Aya  
- Lanna  
- Abdulkarim  

Project Overview:  
The main goal of this project is to design and implement a system that can simulate the control and monitoring of multiple home devices through a simple and reliable interface. The system will show live device status and allow users to perform basic actions such as turning devices on and off, adjusting temperature, and checking alerts.

Folder Structure (planned):  
- Domain – device logic (Light, Door Lock, Heater, Fan, Smoke, Motion, Camera, Temperature)  
- Services – simulation and helper classes  
- App – main dashboard interface  

Development Plan:  
Each team member will work on different device modules on separate branches. The team will use issues and pull requests to track progress and review work before merging into the main branch. During integration, we will test the interaction between all modules and the dashboard.

Sprint 1 Goals:  
- Set up the GitHub repository for the team  
- Create branches and assign tasks for each module  
- Begin initial setup and coding of device classes  
- Prepare the Sprint 1 presentation and demo

This file will be updated as the project progresses.
